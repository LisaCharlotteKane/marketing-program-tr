# Deployment Guide

Your Marketing Campaign Planner app is ready for deployment! Here's how to fix the 404 error:

## GitHub Pages Setup

1. **Repository Settings**:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click Settings → Pages (in the left sidebar)
   - Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
   - The workflow will automatically deploy when you push to main

2. **Build Files**: Your app has already been built successfully! The files are in the `dist/` folder:
   - `index.html` - Main app file
   - `404.html` - For single-page app routing
   - `assets/` - CSS and JavaScript files
   - `campaign_template.csv` - Template file

## Troubleshooting 404 Error

The URL you mentioned seems to be for a GitHub Spark authentication flow that's not working. Here's how to fix it:

### Option 1: Direct GitHub Pages (Recommended)
1. Push your current code to the `main` branch
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. Your app will be available at: `https://[USERNAME].github.io/[REPOSITORY-NAME]/`

### Option 2: Custom Domain
If you want a custom domain:
1. Add a `CNAME` file to the `dist/` folder with your domain
2. Configure DNS settings to point to GitHub Pages

## Verification

Your app should load successfully at the GitHub Pages URL. The app includes:
- ✅ Campaign Planning table
- ✅ Execution Tracking
- ✅ Budget Management
- ✅ Reporting Dashboard
- ✅ Calendar View
- ✅ CSV Import/Export
- ✅ Local storage persistence

## Next Steps

Once deployed, the app will work independently without requiring any authentication or special GitHub Spark runtime features. All data is stored in the browser's local storage.

## Support

If you continue to have issues:
1. Check the GitHub Actions tab for build errors
2. Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
3. Make sure the `main` branch contains the latest code
