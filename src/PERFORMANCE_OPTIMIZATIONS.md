# Performance Optimizations for Marketing Planning Tool

## Problem Areas Identified

1. **Async Imports in Campaign Table**
   - Dynamic imports of budget services inside updateCampaign caused excessive re-renders
   - Async function inside synchronous event handlers slowed UI responsiveness

2. **Input Type Issues**
   - Using type="number" for inputs caused input validation issues
   - Number conversion was creating unnecessary re-renders

3. **Budget Validation Overhead**
   - Multiple dynamic imports for budget validation slowed down UI interactions
   - Excessive budget checks even for minor edits

4. **Excessive Storage Operations**
   - Too frequent saves to localStorage and KV store
   - No debounce to prevent rapid consecutive saves

## Optimizations Implemented

1. **Removed Dynamic Imports**
   - Replaced async imports with hardcoded constants for budget validation
   - Removed unnecessary IIFE and async wrappers around validation logic

2. **Improved Input Handling**
   - Changed inputs to type="text" with manual number parsing
   - Added proper string-to-number conversion with regex cleanup
   - Separated parsing from state updates to reduce re-renders

3. **Streamlined Campaign Updates**
   - Refactored updateCampaign to be fully synchronous
   - Improved number parsing and validation logic
   - Simplified budget validation with direct object references

4. **Enhanced Storage Efficiency**
   - Increased save debounce from 500ms to 2000ms
   - Added data comparison to skip unnecessary saves
   - Improved JSON serialization handling

5. **Simplified Budget Tracking**
   - Hardcoded budget constants to avoid dynamic lookups
   - Streamlined owner-to-region mapping
   - Improved contractor campaign detection

## Results

These optimizations should significantly improve:

- UI responsiveness when editing campaign data
- Performance when adding multiple campaigns
- CSV import speed and reliability
- Overall application stability

All key functionality remains intact:
- Budget validation still works as before
- ROI calculations use the same formulas
- Campaign filtering and reporting are unchanged
- Data persistence functions properly with less overhead
