# Planning Guide: MarketPlanner - Campaign Storage System

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: To provide a persistent, collaborative marketing campaign management system with shared data across all users.
- **Success Indicators**: All campaign data is successfully saved, synchronized, and accessible across different users and devices.
- **Experience Qualities**: Reliable, Collaborative, Seamless.

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- **Primary User Activity**: Creating and Acting (creating and managing marketing campaigns)

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: Marketing teams need to collaboratively plan, track, and manage campaigns with shared visibility.
- **User Context**: Marketing teams accessing the application from different devices and locations need real-time data synchronization.
- **Critical Path**: User creates campaign data → data is stored in shared KV store → data is accessible by all users.
- **Key Moments**: Data synchronization between users, conflict resolution, and backup mechanisms.

## Essential Features
1. **Shared KV Storage**:
   - Functionality: Uses GitHub Spark's `useKV` hook to store all campaign data in a shared KV store
   - Purpose: Enables real-time collaboration between multiple users
   - Success criteria: Data changes by one user are visible to all other users

2. **Local Storage Backup**:
   - Functionality: Maintains a backup copy of data in browser's localStorage
   - Purpose: Provides fallback in case of KV store failure and offline capabilities
   - Success criteria: Data can be recovered from localStorage when KV store is unavailable

3. **Data Synchronization**:
   - Functionality: Periodic checks for updates from other users and manual sync controls
   - Purpose: Ensures all users have the latest data
   - Success criteria: Changes made by one user are propagated to all other users

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Trust, efficiency, and collaboration
- **Design Personality**: Professional, organized, and efficient
- **Visual Metaphors**: Database and cloud storage icons represent shared data persistence
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Clean, minimal interface with clear indicators of data states

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with blue accent colors
- **Primary Color**: Blue (#3b82f6) representing reliability and trust
- **Secondary Colors**: Light greys and whites for a clean interface
- **Accent Color**: Lighter blue (#e0f2fe) for highlighting and drawing attention
- **Color Psychology**: Blues create a sense of security and trust in data storage
- **Color Accessibility**: High contrast between text and backgrounds ensures readability
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: Dark text on light backgrounds for optimal readability

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Single sans-serif font (Inter) for consistency and readability
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear size differentiation between headers and body text
- **Font Personality**: Professional, clean, and highly legible
- **Readability Focus**: Appropriate line height and spacing for dense information
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent font usage throughout the application
- **Which fonts**: Inter from Google Fonts
- **Legibility Check**: High legibility for technical information and data displays

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Storage status information and synchronization controls are prominently displayed
- **White Space Philosophy**: Adequate spacing to prevent information overload
- **Grid System**: Flexbox-based layout with responsive behavior
- **Responsive Approach**: Column stacking on smaller screens
- **Content Density**: Balanced density showing sufficient information without overwhelming

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle loading indicators for synchronization actions
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Minimal animations focused on status changes
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Animations limited to functional feedback rather than decoration

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Cards for containment, buttons for actions, and tabs for organization
- **Component Customization**: Tailwind styling for consistent appearance
- **Component States**: Clear visual feedback for loading, success, and error states
- **Icon Selection**: Database, cloud, and synchronization icons to represent data operations
- **Component Hierarchy**: Primary actions (sync) are visually distinct from secondary actions
- **Spacing System**: Consistent padding and margins using Tailwind's spacing scale
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Stacked layout on smaller screens with full-width controls

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based design with consistent styling
- **Style Guide Elements**: Consistent use of card containers, button styles, and spacing
- **Visual Rhythm**: Repeated patterns of information display and controls
- **Brand Alignment**: Professional appearance consistent with GitHub's design language

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance with high contrast text on all backgrounds

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Potential Obstacles**: Network connectivity issues, data conflicts between users
- **Edge Case Handling**: Fallback to localStorage when KV store is unavailable
- **Technical Constraints**: KV store size limitations and potential performance issues with large datasets

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Support for increasing numbers of campaigns and users
- **Testing Focus**: Synchronization between multiple users and data integrity
- **Critical Questions**: How to handle conflicting changes from multiple users simultaneously

## Reflection
- This approach provides a robust multi-layered storage solution uniquely suited for collaborative campaign management
- The combination of shared KV store with localStorage backup balances real-time collaboration with reliability
- Exceptional implementation includes automatic conflict resolution and offline editing capabilities
