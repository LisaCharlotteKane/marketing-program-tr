### Accessibility & Readability
**Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance maintained throughout
**Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility for all interactions
**Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML

## Implementation Considerations

### Technical Architecture
- React with TypeScript for type safety
- Local storage for data persistence (with cleanup tools)
- Shadcn/ui for consistent component library
- Phosphor Icons for visual consistency

### Data Management
- Campaign data stored as JSON in localStorage
- Budget calculations performed client-side
- CSV import/export for data portability
- Error boundaries for graceful failure handling

### Performance
- Optimized for 100+ campaigns
- Storage monitoring and cleanup tools
- Lazy loading for large datasets
- Efficient re-rendering patterns

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios

### Storage Limitations
- **Problem**: Browser localStorage limits (5-10MB)
- **Solution**: Storage monitoring with cleanup tools and warnings

### Data Validation
- **Problem**: Invalid CSV imports or corrupt data
- **Solution**: Comprehensive validation with clear error messages

### Budget Overruns
- **Problem**: Campaigns exceeding allocated budgets
- **Solution**: Visual warnings but allow creation for planning purposes

### Concurrent Usage
- **Problem**: Multiple users making changes simultaneously
- **Solution**: Current localStorage approach - future enhancement for real-time sync

## Reflection

This solution uniquely combines:
- Automated ROI calculations with industry-standard conversion rates
- Owner-based budget tracking separate from regional reporting
- Comprehensive data management with import/export capabilities
- Built-in storage optimization to prevent common browser issues

The tool transforms ad-hoc campaign planning into a standardized, trackable process that provides immediate value to marketing operations teams while scaling to enterprise requirements.
