## Core Purpose & Success

### Mission Statement
Allow marketing teams to persist campaign planning data across sessions and team members by saving data to a GitHub repository.

### Success Indicators
- Successful saving and loading of campaign data to/from GitHub repositories
- No data loss during synchronization
- User confidence in data persistence

### Experience Qualities
- Reliable: Data is consistently saved and retrieved without errors
- Transparent: Clear feedback on operation success or failure
- Secure: Handles authentication properly with token-based access

## Project Classification & Approach

### Complexity Level
Light Application Feature: Adds persistence functionality to an existing feature-rich application

### Primary User Activity
Acting: Users primarily use this feature to save and retrieve their work

## Thought Process for Feature Selection

### Core Problem Analysis
Marketing teams need to persist campaign planning data across sessions and share it between team members, especially when planning spans multiple quarters.

### User Context
Users will engage with this feature after creating or updating campaign plans, or when they need to retrieve previously saved data.

### Critical Path
1. User enters GitHub credentials and repository details
2. User chooses to save current data or load existing data
3. System performs the requested operation and provides feedback
4. User continues working with the updated/loaded data

### Key Moments
- Successful first-time save to GitHub (creating the persistence file)
- Loading data from different fiscal years/files
- Handling error states gracefully when network or permission issues occur

## Essential Features

### GitHub Repository Integration
- **Functionality**: Connect to GitHub API to read/write campaign data
- **Purpose**: Provide persistent storage in a familiar developer environment
- **Success Criteria**: Successfully authenticate, read, and write to GitHub repositories

### Campaign Data Serialization
- **Functionality**: Convert campaign data to/from JSON format
- **Purpose**: Enable storage in GitHub repository files
- **Success Criteria**: No data loss or corruption during conversion

### Multi-File Support
- **Functionality**: Support different files for different fiscal years
- **Purpose**: Allow organizing campaign data by time periods
- **Success Criteria**: Successfully save to and load from different path names

### Error Handling
- **Functionality**: Provide clear feedback for success and failure states
- **Purpose**: Help users understand and resolve issues
- **Success Criteria**: User can successfully troubleshoot common errors

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Confidence and reliability
- **Design Personality**: Professional and trustworthy
- **Visual Metaphors**: Cloud storage, syncing, databases
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface with just essential controls

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Matches the existing application's color scheme
- **Primary Color**: Blue (#3b82f6) to match the primary app color
- **Secondary Colors**: Green for success states, red for errors
- **Accent Color**: None needed for this feature
- **Color Psychology**: Blue conveys trust and reliability for data operations
- **Color Accessibility**: All colors maintain WCAG AA compliance
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: Maintaining existing app standards

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Using the existing app's font (Inter)
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between labels, values, and messages
- **Font Personality**: Clean and professional
- **Readability Focus**: High contrast for form inputs and status messages
- **Typography Consistency**: Maintaining existing typographic system
- **Legibility Check**: All text remains highly legible even in error states

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Form fields at top, status messages below, action buttons at bottom
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing between form elements for clarity
- **Grid System**: Card-based layout with form controls in a responsive grid
- **Responsive Approach**: Stack controls vertically on mobile, side-by-side on desktop
- **Content Density**: Low density to emphasize the importance of each input

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Card container, form inputs, select dropdowns, buttons
- **Component Customization**: Status alerts with appropriate colors for feedback
- **Component States**: Clear disabled states for buttons when required fields are missing
- **Icon Selection**: Database icon for tab, cloud icons for save/load operations
- **Component Hierarchy**: Card > Form > Actions flow
- **Spacing System**: Consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Stack form inputs vertically on smaller screens

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based, reusing existing UI components
- **Style Guide Elements**: Following existing application conventions
- **Visual Rhythm**: Consistent spacing and alignment of all elements
- **Brand Alignment**: Extends the existing application design language

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance for all text and UI elements

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Potential Obstacles**: Missing or invalid GitHub tokens, network failures
- **Edge Case Handling**: Clear error messages for common failure modes
- **Technical Constraints**: GitHub API rate limiting, file size limitations

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Support for multiple files as campaign data grows
- **Testing Focus**: Network failure handling, authentication edge cases
- **Critical Questions**: How to handle merge conflicts if multiple users update the same file?

## Reflection
- This approach uniquely combines familiar GitHub tools with marketing planning needs
- We've assumed users will have GitHub access and know how to create tokens
- Making this solution exceptional would involve adding automated background sync and conflict resolution
