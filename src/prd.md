# Marketing Campaign Planner - Error Resolution PRD

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: Provide a reliable, error-free marketing campaign planning tool for APAC marketing operations
- **Success Indicators**: Zero runtime errors, stable data persistence, no HTTP 431 errors
- **Experience Qualities**: Reliable, Fast, User-friendly

## Issues Resolved

### 1. HTTP 431 "Request Header Fields Too Large" Error
**Problem**: Large data stored in localStorage was causing browser header size limits to be exceeded
**Solution**: 
- Implemented storage monitoring and cleanup utilities
- Added size limits to prevent storage bloat
- Created automatic cleanup of debug/temp data
- Added storage status monitoring component

### 2. TypeScript and Build Errors
**Problem**: Various TS compilation errors preventing clean builds
**Solution**:
- Fixed import paths and removed .ts extensions
- Centralized type definitions in `/types/campaign.ts`
- Updated hook signatures and type annotations
- Fixed React 18 compatibility issues

### 3. Storage Management
**Problem**: Uncontrolled storage growth leading to performance issues
**Solution**:
- Implemented `useStorageMonitor` hook for real-time monitoring
- Added automatic cleanup of large items (>50KB)
- Created storage size limits and warnings
- Added manual cleanup functionality

## Key Features Implemented

### Storage Monitoring
- Real-time storage usage tracking
- Automatic cleanup warnings when storage exceeds 2MB
- Manual cleanup button for users
- Prevention of storing items larger than 1MB

### Error Prevention
- Comprehensive error boundaries in React components
- Global error handlers for unhandled exceptions
- Graceful fallbacks for storage quota exceeded errors
- Input validation and type safety

### Clean Architecture
- Centralized type definitions
- Utility functions for safe data conversion
- Modular component structure
- Proper separation of concerns

## Technical Implementation

### Core Files Modified
- `src/App.tsx` - Main application with storage monitoring
- `src/hooks/useKV.ts` - Enhanced with size limits and error handling
- `src/lib/storage-cleanup.ts` - Storage cleanup utilities
- `src/hooks/useStorageMonitor.ts` - Real-time storage monitoring
- `index.html` - Simplified to reduce header bloat

### Performance Optimizations
- Debounced storage operations
- Lazy loading of large data sets
- Efficient component re-rendering
- Memory leak prevention

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Zero HTTP 431 errors
- ✅ Clean TypeScript compilation
- ✅ Stable data persistence
- ✅ Real-time storage monitoring
- ✅ Graceful error handling
- ✅ User-friendly storage management

## Future Considerations
- Implement server-side storage for large datasets
- Add data compression for localStorage
- Create backup/restore functionality
- Implement progressive data loading
