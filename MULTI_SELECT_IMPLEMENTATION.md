# Multi-Select Strategic Pillar CSV Import Implementation

## Summary of Changes Made

### ✅ Multiple Selection Support for Strategic Pillar on CSV Import

The campaign planning tool now fully supports importing campaigns with multiple strategic pillars from CSV files. Here are the key features implemented:

#### 1. CSV Format Support
- **Separator Support**: Both comma (`,`) and semicolon (`;`) separators are supported
- **Format Examples**:
  - Single pillar: `"Account Growth and Product Adoption"`
  - Multiple pillars (comma): `"Account Growth and Product Adoption, Pipeline Acceleration & Executive Engagement"`
  - Multiple pillars (semicolon): `"Account Growth and Product Adoption; Pipeline Acceleration & Executive Engagement"`

#### 2. Components Updated

**Campaign Manager (`src/components/campaign-manager.tsx`)**:
- ✅ CSV import function now parses multiple strategic pillars correctly
- ✅ Handles both comma and semicolon separators
- ✅ Filters out empty values

**CSV Uploader (`src/components/csv-uploader.tsx`)**:
- ✅ Updated to parse multiple strategic pillars from CSV
- ✅ Supports both comma and semicolon separators
- ✅ Updated CSV template to show multi-select examples

**CSV Helper (`src/utils/csv-helper.ts`)**:
- ✅ Fixed field name inconsistencies (strategicPillars → strategicPillar)
- ✅ Added support for multiple column name variations
- ✅ Enhanced validation for strategic pillar arrays
- ✅ Proper handling of comma and semicolon separators

#### 3. CSV Template Updated
The download template now includes examples of:
- Single strategic pillar campaigns
- Multiple strategic pillar campaigns using semicolon separation
- Proper CSV formatting with quotes around multi-value fields

#### 4. Data Structure Consistency
- ✅ All components now use the correct `strategicPillar: string[]` field from the Campaign interface
- ✅ Fixed field name mismatches between components
- ✅ Consistent handling across import, export, and UI editing

#### 5. Import Process Flow
1. **Parse CSV**: Detect Strategic Pillar column values
2. **Split Values**: Use regex `/[,;]/` to split on both commas and semicolons
3. **Clean Values**: Trim whitespace and filter out empty strings
4. **Validate**: Check each pillar against valid options
5. **Store**: Save as string array in campaign object

#### 6. Example CSV Formats Supported

```csv
Campaign Name,Campaign Type,Strategic Pillar,Revenue Play,FY,Quarter/Month,Region,Country,Owner,Description,Forecasted Cost,Expected Leads
Multi-Pillar Campaign,Webinars,"Account Growth and Product Adoption; Pipeline Acceleration & Executive Engagement",All,FY26,Q1 - July,JP & Korea,Japan,Tomoko Tanaka,Test campaign,10000,200
Single Pillar Campaign,Events,Brand Awareness & Top of Funnel Demand Generation,All,FY26,Q2 - October,SAARC,India,Shruti Narang,Single pillar test,5000,100
```

### ✅ Testing
- Created test CSV file demonstrating multiple strategic pillar support
- Verified compatibility with existing campaign data structure
- Ensured backward compatibility with single pillar campaigns

### ✅ User Experience
- **Seamless Import**: Users can now include multiple strategic pillars in their CSV imports
- **Flexible Format**: Support for both comma and semicolon separators accommodates different CSV export formats
- **Clear Templates**: Download template shows exactly how to format multi-select values
- **Error Handling**: Clear validation messages when pillar names don't match expected values

The implementation ensures that teams can efficiently bulk import campaigns with complex strategic pillar associations while maintaining data integrity and user-friendly error handling.
