# Fixed TypeScript and Import Errors

## Issues Resolved:

1. **Fixed Toaster Import**: Changed from `import { Toaster } from "sonner"` to `import { Toaster } from "@/components/ui/sonner"` to use the properly configured shadcn Toaster component.

2. **Fixed useKV Hook Import**: Changed from `import { useKV } from "@github/spark/hooks"` to `import { useKV } from "@/hooks/useKV"` to use the local implementation that actually exists.

3. **Updated React 19 Imports**: Removed explicit React imports where not needed since React 19 has automatic JSX runtime:
   - `App.tsx`: Changed `import React, { useState, useEffect }` to `import { useState, useEffect }`
   - `SimpleApp.tsx`: Changed `import React` to `import { useEffect }` and updated usage
   - `MinimalApp.tsx`: Removed unused React import
   - `main.tsx`: Updated to use specific imports from React

4. **Cleaned Up Type Declarations**: 
   - Removed duplicate `@github/spark/hooks` declarations from global type files
   - Kept only the local useKV implementation

5. **Component Consistency**: All shadcn components are now properly imported and should work correctly with the existing theme system.

## Result:
All major TypeScript compilation errors should now be resolved. The application uses consistent local implementations where available and properly configured shadcn components throughout.
