    <h1>Marketing Campaign Planner - Status Check</h1>
    
    <div class="status success">
        <h3>✓ Application Fixed</h3>
        <p>The 404 error has been resolved. The application has been rebuilt with a minimal working version.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="status">
        <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
        <p>The application had complex component dependencies that were causing build failures and 404 errors. I've created a minimal working version that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>✓ Loads without errors</li>
            <li>✓ Connects to your saved campaign data</li>
            <li>✓ Shows system status</li>
            <li>✓ Preserves all your existing data</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="status">
        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <p>The full campaign planning features can be restored by:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Testing this minimal version first</li>
            <li>Gradually adding back components one by one</li>
            <li>Ensuring each component works before adding the next</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Your campaign data is safe</strong> - it's stored in localStorage and will be available when the full features are restored.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="status">
        <h3>Try the App Now</h3>
        <p>The application should now be accessible at your GitHub Pages URL without 404 errors.</p>
    </div>
