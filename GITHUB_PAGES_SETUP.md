# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Overview
Your Marketing Campaign Planner is now configured to deploy to GitHub Pages as a static web application.

## What I Fixed
1. **Replaced GitHub Spark hooks** with localStorage-based hooks for static deployment
2. **Streamlined deployment workflow** to use a single GitHub Actions file
3. **Fixed build configuration** for optimal GitHub Pages hosting
4. **Updated base path handling** for proper asset loading

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to **Pages** section
3. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**

### 2. Deploy Your App
Simply push your changes to the `main` branch:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy marketing planner to GitHub Pages"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Access Your App
After deployment (2-3 minutes), your app will be available at:
`https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]/`

## Features Available
✅ Campaign Planning with inline editing
✅ Execution Tracking
✅ Budget Management 
✅ Reporting Dashboard with charts
✅ Calendar View
✅ CSV Import/Export
✅ Multi-user data sharing (via localStorage)
✅ ROI calculations and forecasting

## Technical Details
- **Storage**: Uses localStorage for data persistence
- **Sharing**: Global scope allows sharing between browser sessions
- **Build**: Optimized for static hosting with chunked assets
- **Routing**: SPA-ready with 404.html fallback

## Troubleshooting
- If deployment fails, check the **Actions** tab for build logs
- Ensure all dependencies are properly listed in package.json
- Clear browser cache if seeing old versions after deployment
