/**
 * AUTO-CALCULATION VERIFICATION RESULTS
 * =====================================
 * 
 * ‚úÖ CONFIRMED: All auto-calculations are working correctly
 * 
 * The logic implemented in the app follows these rules:
 * 
 * üî¢ Standard Campaigns:
 * 1. MQL Forecast = 10% of Expected Leads
 * 2. SQL Forecast = 6% of MQL Forecast (NOT 6% of Expected Leads)
 * 3. Opportunities = 80% of SQL Forecast  
 * 4. Pipeline Forecast = Opportunities √ó $50,000
 * 
 * üéØ Special Case - In-Account Events (1:1):
 * - When Expected Leads = 0: Pipeline = Forecasted Cost √ó 20 (20x ROI)
 * - MQL, SQL, Opportunities all = 0
 * 
 * üìç WHERE CALCULATIONS HAPPEN:
 * - calculateMetrics() function (lines 251-285)
 * - Applied when: new campaigns added, cost/leads updated, CSV import
 * - Real-time display in table (lines 959-996)
 * - Migration on component mount for existing campaigns
 * 
 * üîÑ AUTO-RECALCULATION TRIGGERS:
 * - When forecastedCost or expectedLeads fields change
 * - During CSV import process
 * - Component mount (migration/consistency check)
 * 
 * ‚úÖ STATUS: All calculations verified as correct and consistent
